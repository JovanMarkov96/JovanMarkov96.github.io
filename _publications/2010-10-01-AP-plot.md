title: "Calibration of the momentum scale of a particle physics detector using the Armenteros-Podolanski plot"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-06-28-AP-plot
excerpt: 'A method for calibrating the momentum scale in a particle physics detector is described. The method relies on the determination of the masses of the final state particles in two-body decays of neutral particles, which can then be used to obtain corrections in the momentum scale. A modified version of the Armenteros-Podolanski plot and the KS0 → π+ π- decay is used as a proof of principle for this method. A precision at the 10-6–10-8 level is achieved in simplified simulations.'
