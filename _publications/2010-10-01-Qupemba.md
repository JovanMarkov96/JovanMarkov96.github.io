title: "The inverse Mpemba effect demonstrated on a single trapped ion qubit"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-06-28-Qpemba
excerpt: 'Here we propose a quantum analog of the Mpemba effect, on the simplest quantum system, a qubit. Specifically, we show it exhibits an inverse effect, in which a cold qubit reaches a hot temperature faster than a hot qubit. Furthermore, in our system a cold qubit can heat up exponentially faster, manifesting the strong version of the effect. This occurs only for sufficiently coherent systems, making this effect quantum mechanical, i.e. due to interference effects.'
