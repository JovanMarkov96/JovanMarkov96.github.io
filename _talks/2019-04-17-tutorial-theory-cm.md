I conducted a tutorial on theoretical classical mechanics for students attending the Physics Seminar 2. The session began with a lecture introducing the concepts of Lagrangian, action, and the variational principle. This was followed by a problem-solving session. The lecture was based on the Feynman Lectures on Physics, and the problems were derived from the Landau and Lifshitz Classical Mechanics textbook.
