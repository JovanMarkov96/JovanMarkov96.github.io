Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field, and several companies are leveraging trapped ion technology to build their quantum computers. Trapped ions are a promising approach due to their long coherence times and high-fidelity operations. Here are some of the leading companies in this space:

## What Is Trapped Ion Quantum Computing?

Trapped Ion Quantum Computing is a method of quantum computing that uses ions (charged atoms) suspended in a magnetic or electric field as qubits (quantum bits) for information processing. It uses ion traps, which are devices that can contain a single ion or multiple ions in order to perform controlled operations on them. These trapped ions are then manipulated using laser beams, electric fields, and magnetic fields in order to process information. By controlling the interactions between these qubits, complex calculations can be performed, allowing for the computation of problems that would otherwise not be possible with classical computing.

As technology advances, Trapped Ion Quantum Computing has the potential to revolutionize computer technology and usher in a new era of completely quantum computing. By harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, trapped ion quantum computers could potentially surpass even the most powerful classical computers in terms of speed, accuracy, and complexity. This could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as artificial intelligence, drug design, cryptography, and much more. As we move forward into the future of computing technologies, Trapped Ion Quantum Computing will play an increasingly important role in pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

Quantinuum's technology is based on trapped ion quantum computing, which uses ions suspended in electromagnetic fields as qubits. This approach supports all-to-all qubit connectivity, allowing entangled states to be created between all qubits, and enables high fidelity of quantum states.

**Achievements:**
Quantinuum has developed the H-Series quantum computers, which have set records for quantum volume, reaching 1,048,576 in April 2024. The company also holds the record for two-qubit gate fidelity, becoming the first to reach 99.9%. They have developed middleware and software products for various applications, including cybersecurity, quantum chemistry, and machine learning. Quantinuum has also raised $625 million in funding and is valued at $5 billion.

**Future Plans:**
Quantinuum aims to continue improving the performance and scalability of its quantum processors. They plan to develop more sophisticated quantum algorithms and applications that can solve complex problems in fields such as cryptography, material science, and drug discovery. The company is also focused on expanding its quantum computing ecosystem through partnerships and collaborations with academic and industrial partners.

### IonQ

- **Established:** 2015
- **Founders:** Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim
- **Related Universities/Institutes:** University of Maryland and Duke University
- **Headquarters:** College Park, Maryland

IonQ is a quantum computing hardware and software company based in College Park, Maryland. The company is developing a general-purpose trapped ion quantum computer and software to generate, optimize, and execute quantum circuits.

**History:**
IonQ was co-founded by Christopher Monroe and Jungsang Kim, professors at Duke University, in 2015, with the help of Harry Weller and Andrew Schoen from New Enterprise Associates. The company is an offshoot of the co-founders’ 25 years of academic research in quantum information science. Monroe's research began at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with Nobel-laureate physicist David Wineland, where he led a team using trapped ions to produce the first controllable qubits and quantum logic gate. Kim and Monroe's collaboration was furthered by research initiatives funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA).

In 2015, New Enterprise Associates invested $2 million to commercialize the technology proposed by Monroe and Kim. In 2017, IonQ raised a $20 million series B, led by GV (formerly Google Ventures) and New Enterprise Associates. In May 2019, former Amazon Prime executive Peter Chapman was named CEO. IonQ partnered to make its quantum computers available through Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. In October 2021, IonQ became publicly listed on the New York Stock Exchange via a special-purpose acquisition company. The company opened a dedicated research and development facility in Bothell, Washington, in February 2024.

**Technology:**
IonQ’s hardware is based on a trapped ion architecture, developed from technology by Monroe at the University of Maryland and Kim at Duke. Their system uses a microfabricated ion trap and several optical and acousto-optical systems to cool, initialize, and calculate. IonQ also provides a cloud API, custom language bindings, and quantum computing simulators that leverage their trapped ion system's complete connectivity. Trapped ions offer benefits such as accuracy, scalability, predictability, and coherence time, although some criticize the slow operational times and relative size of the hardware.
