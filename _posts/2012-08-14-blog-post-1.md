Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field, and several companies are leveraging trapped ion technology to build their quantum computers. Trapped ions are a promising approach due to their long coherence times and high-fidelity operations. Here are some of the leading companies in this space:

## What Is Trapped Ion Quantum Computing?

Trapped Ion Quantum Computing is a method of quantum computing that uses ions (charged atoms) suspended in a magnetic or electric field as qubits (quantum bits) for information processing. It uses ion traps, which are devices that can contain a single ion or multiple ions in order to perform controlled operations on them. These trapped ions are then manipulated using laser beams, electric fields, and magnetic fields in order to process information. By controlling the interactions between these qubits, complex calculations can be performed, allowing for the computation of problems that would otherwise not be possible with classical computing.

As technology advances, Trapped Ion Quantum Computing has the potential to revolutionize computer technology and usher in a new era of completely quantum computing. By harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, trapped ion quantum computers could potentially surpass even the most powerful classical computers in terms of speed, accuracy, and complexity. This could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as artificial intelligence, drug design, cryptography, and much more. As we move forward into the future of computing technologies, Trapped Ion Quantum Computing will play an increasingly important role in pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

### Quantinuum

Quantinuum came about in 2021 when Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC), a best-in-class software company, merged with Honeywell Quantum Solutions’ high-performing trapped-ion hardware. In the business to scale trapped ion quantum computing and develop applications today to solve the world’s most pressing challenges, Quantinuum is bound to be a force in the years to come.

Quantinuum is led by CEO Ilyas Khan, who founded CQC back in 2014. Tony Uttley, meanwhile — founder and President of Honeywell Quantum Solutions — serves as President and COO of the new enterprise.

### IonQ

Based in College Park, Maryland, IonQ was founded in 2015 by Chris Monroe and Jungsang Kim with $2 million in seed funding from New Enterprise Associates, a license to core technology from the University of Maryland and Duke University. A trailblazer in the QC industry, IonQ’s mission is to build the world’s best quantum computers to solve the world’s most complex problems, transforming business, society, and the planet for the better.

Its unique trapped-ion approach combines unmatched physical performance, perfect qubit replication, optical networkability, and highly-optimized algorithms to create a trapped ion quantum computer that is as scalable as it is powerful, and that will support a broad array of applications across a variety of industries.

### Quantum Factory

Quantum Factory was founded in 2018 in Munich by Alexander Hüsers and Björn Stein. Aiming to develop the first universally applicable ion-based quantum computer, that, unlike other commercialized quantum providers, can efficiently calculate the full spectrum of what is physically possible and thus offers clearly wider and more comprehensive application potential than it is possible today.

### Alpine Quantum Technologies

Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT) was founded in 2018 by Rainer Blatt, Thomas Monz and Peter Zoller and is working on general-purpose quantum information processors that will support a broad range of applications in various industries using a scalable trapped-ion approach that combines unmatched physical performance, extraordinary qubit control, and demonstrated optical networkability.

AQT is supported by the Federation of Austrian Industries Tyrol, the FFG Austrian Research Promotion Agency and the University of Innsbruck.

### Oxford Ionics

With headquarters in Begbroke, Oxfordshire, Oxford Ionics was founded in 2019 by Chris Ballance and Thomas Harty. The startup is creating high-performance quantum computers by combining the world’s highest quality qubits — trapped ions — with the team’s unique noiseless electronic qubit control technology.

### eleQtron

eleQtron develops and operates quantum computers based on trapped ions, RF control and Magnetic Gradient Induced Coupling (MAGIC). Its intermediate-scale quantum processors will be optimized for near-term industrially relevant quantum applications. The startup will also implement breakthrough concepts for scalable quantum processors based on RF-controlled trapped ions. eleQtron will operate MAGIC quantum computers and offer quantum computer performance within a subscription model.

The Siegen, Germany-based company was founded in 2020 by Michael Johanning and Jan Henrik Leisse.
