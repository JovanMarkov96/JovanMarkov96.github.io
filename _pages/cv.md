Projects, Internships
======
* 2021: MSc thesis, Project: Ultralight dark matter: Ground state solutions in the presence of two fields, Advisor: Prof. Kfir Blum.
* 2019: Summer Student Program, CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Project: [Top quarks in the lepton + jets channel in PbPb collisions](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2687408/files/Jovan_Markov_CERN_Summer_School_2019_project_report%20final.pdf). Mentors (CMS): Pedro Ferreira daSilva, Émilien Chapon.
* 2017: Summer Research Student, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. Kupcinet-Getz International Summer School, Mentor (ATLAS) Prof. Alexander Milov. Studied the production of Z bosons in the di-electron decay channel in proton-proton (pp) collisions which was measured in the ATLAS detector. The results from pp collisions were compared to the previously measured data in the proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions system at the same energy. Information on the nuclear modification factor $RpPb$, for Z bosons in p-Pb collisions was extracted from the comparison. The whole data analysis was done by writing C++ scripts using ROOT. [Booklet](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/atlas/sites/particle.atlas/files/uploads/heavy-ion-physics.pdf) with our projects.
